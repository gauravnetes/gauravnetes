### Hi there, I'm Gourav ğŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Information Technology student passionate about building practical tools and exploring the intersection of full-stack development and machine learning.

I'm currently focused on:
- Building scalable, full-stack applications with React, Next.js, and Node.js.
- Applying Deep Learning (PyTorch) to real-world problems, specifically in medical imaging analysis.
- Creating useful developer tools and contributing to open-source projects.
